QnA

Q. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

-> We are trying to solve a ship detection problem for high resolution satellite images.

Q. How does your idea address the problem?

-> Our idea is to divide the high resolution satellite images into smaller images and then 
   process it through YOLOv3 deep learning model to detect the ships in the smaller images
   and again combine the smaller images to a single high resolution image.

Q. Who are the target customers?

-> ISRO(Indian Space Research Organisation) is the target customer.

Q. What makes your idea unique?

-> High Resolution satellite images can't be fed directly to any deep learning model as it leads
   the generation of an enormous number of parameters.So, the dividing of high resolution image
   into smaller images and then feeding them to the model makes our idea efficient and unique.

Q. Do you have a revenue generation model?

-> No

Q. What are the geographies, do you think the idea would be suitable for?

-> Our idea would be suitable for detecting all types of ships(size invariant) for any satellite image 
   from all the major platforms like Google Earth,PlanetLabs etc.

Q. What are the risks associated with your idea and how can you mitigate it?

-> No deep learning model gives 100% accurate predictions.But we can try to increase the accuracy as much
   as possible by adjusting various parameters.

Q. Who are the stakeholders involved in order to take bring this idea/product/service to the market?

-> ISRO

Q. Is your idea patentable or patented?

-> Our idea is non-patentable.

Q. Is your idea built existing work? If so how is it different?

-> Our ideas is live in the form of a website. It is different in the way that it can process high resolution
   satellite images with great efficiency and accuracy.

Q. What is the nature of the prototype/ proof of concept, you would be able to submit?

-> Github repository (https://github.com/gauravv0412/artemis)

Q. Have you completed pilot tests for your prototype/POC?

-> Yes.The results of the pilot tests have been pushed to the github repository.

Q. What is the approximate cost of developing the prototype?

-> The prototype has been developed without any cost.

Q. Please share the relevant elements while submitting the POC/ Prototype

-> The block diagram has been pushed to the github repository in the form of an image.

Q. What regulatory requirements have to be met to bring the idea to life?

-> A powerful GPU is required at the backend to make predictions even faster.

Q. Do you have a business plan/ commercialization strategy?

-> No

Q. What is rough estimate of manufacturing/operational costs?

-> The operational costs are just for a server running the model.

Q. What is volume of products/ amount of revenue do you expect to make in the first year?

-> It is a non-revenue generation model.
